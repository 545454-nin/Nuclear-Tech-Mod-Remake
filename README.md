# Nuclear-Tech-Mod-Remake
**This is a remake of the Nuclear Tech Mod originally created by [HbmMods](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).**
It is currently being developed for the 1.16.5 Minecraft version.
Everything is still subject to change, even the speed at which blocks get mined. This mod is not ready for general use yet and everything is work in progress.

### Development builds

But you can still test the current state of the mod by either building the mod yourself, or downloading one of the [occasional releases published on GitHub](https://github.com/MartinTheDragon/Nuclear-Tech-Mod-Remake/releases). Finding and reporting bugs is encouraged.
