If you just want to make an early build of the mod, only having [IntelliJ IDEA installed][intellij] will suffice.
You can then proceed to building the mod.<br>
But if you are planning to get your hands on the code of the mod to do some changes, you will need to have learned
[Kotlin]. If you wonder why this project uses Kotlin instead of Java, click [here][why-kotlin]. But don't mistake Kotlin
as a complete replacement of Java. Kotlin compiles to all platforms and it can even compile to JavaScript, but in this
case it actually compiles to Java. For Minecraft/Forge the mod will still look like it was written in Java.<br>
There are just a lot of cases where Kotlin requires way less work for achieving the same thing.

Of course you will also need Minecraft and some knowledge about Forge modding; and this guide will take that for granted.
