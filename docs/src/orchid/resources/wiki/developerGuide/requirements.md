If you just want to make an early build of the mod, only downloading the source and [building the mod with the command
line][building_cmd] will suffice. Though be aware that if you do this,
a lot of files will be downloaded. And if you have a weak computer, it is going to take a long time. The first build time
commonly ranges from thirty minutes to just five and every following build usually takes around five minutes to one
minute to complete.<br>
But if you are planning to get your hands on the code of the mod to do some changes, you will need to have learned
[Kotlin]{target="_blank"}. If you wonder why this project uses Kotlin instead of Java, click [here][why-kotlin]{target="_blank"}. But don't mistake Kotlin
for a complete replacement of Java. Kotlin compiles to all platforms and it can even compile to JavaScript, but in this
case it actually compiles to Java. For Minecraft/Forge the mod will still look like it was written in Java.<br>
There are just a lot of cases where Kotlin requires way less work for achieving the same thing.

Of course you will also need Minecraft and some knowledge about Forge modding; and this guide will take that for granted.
