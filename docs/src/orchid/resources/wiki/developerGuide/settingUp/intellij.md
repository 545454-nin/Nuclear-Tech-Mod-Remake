Because the mod is written in [Kotlin] and Kotlin is native to [IntelliJ IDEA], IntelliJ IDEA is the optimal IDE.<br>
Not only that, IntelliJ comes with great integrated support for [Gradle], Forge's build system [of choice][forge_reference].<br>
[Eclipse] isn't that bad too. It is actually the first IDE I have ever used and great for beginners.
Choose the one which you prefer, but keep in mind that this guide assumes you are using IntelliJ. Check out the
[Forge Documentation] as it might also be helpful for setting things up if you consider using Eclipse. You will then 
also have to install the [Kotlin Plugin for Eclipse].

[Download] and install IntelliJ IDEA. The setup wizard should guide you through the installation.<br>
If you already have it installed, skip to the next page.

This is optional, but if you want to manage all of your projects created with any [JetBrains] tool or update your 
installed tools easier, all from one interface, I can recommend using [JetBrains Toolbox]. *(Not sponsored)*
